.bat works only on Windows OS and should be in the same folder with kurs_nbu.py file.
Change paths in nbu.bat in order for it to work properly (first path is python.exe path, second - to kurs_nbu.py file).
Python requires requests, datetime, and decimal modules to be installed (python pip install <modulename>).
